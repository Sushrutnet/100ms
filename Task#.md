1. Infrastructure Setup:
Cloud Platform: AWS
Service Used: Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Provisioning Tool: Terraform
App Deployment: Flask app containerized with Docker
Steps:

I used Terraform to provision the AWS infrastructure, including the EKS cluster.
Configured kubectl to connect to the cluster and deploy the Flask app using Kubernetes.
Exposed the Flask app through a LoadBalancer service, ensuring public accessibility via a public endpoint.
2. Monitoring Setup:
Tool Used: AWS CloudWatch
Steps:

Set up CloudWatch monitoring to track key metrics (CPU, memory usage) for the EKS cluster.
Created a custom CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the health of the Flask app, CPU, and memory usage.
Integrated the monitoring with the Flask app to ensure smooth operations and visibility.
3. Outcome:
The Flask app is successfully deployed on AWS EKS and accessible via a public endpoint.
Monitoring is set up using CloudWatch, ensuring that the appâ€™s health and resource usage are continuously tracked.
Technologies Used:
AWS EKS
Terraform
Docker
Kubernetes
AWS CloudWatch
This deployment showcases my experience with cloud infrastructure, containerization, and monitoring in production environments, ensuring scalability and high availability.
